# TrumpTimelines

A website to house a collection of timelines highlighting the misbehavior of President Donald J. Trump. Because there is so much of it, it will be separated into categories.

These categories are his attitudes and actions toward:
      - Females
      - Military
      - Minorities
      - U.S. Citizens
Please note that I am not working on the timelines in this order.

Potential entries and sources are welcome! Please contact me by email or Twitter.
