# TrumpTimelines

A website to house a collection of timelines highlighting the misbehavior of President Donald J. Trump. Because there is so much of it, it will be separated into categories.

These categories include:

      - Abuse of power/taxpayer dollars
      
      - Mishandling COVID-19
      
      - Military Mistreatment
      
      - Misogynistic Behavior  
      
      - Prejudiced & Racist Actions
      
      - Other things (to be named!)

Potential entries and sources are welcome! Please contact me by email or Twitter.
